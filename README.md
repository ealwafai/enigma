Functionality: Meets Expectations

I had a fun time working on the project but i ran out of time so i didn't manage to work on the Cracking method. Overall the encrypt and decrypt work. The hardest part for me was those two but Mike's File I/O video helped a lot.


Object Oriented Programming: Meets Expectations
I didn't have time to refactor and include inheritance and modules but i believe i have the appropriate number of classes to get the code to function.

Ruby Conventions and Mechanics: Meets Expectations
I don't use a Hash but i have proper indention, methods under 10 lines long. I tried my best to use the "Useful Methods" i believe the only one wasn't used was Array#rotate.

Test Driven Development: Meets Expectations
Although i do have 100% coverage i believe i could've added some more testing. I didn't understand why my percentages kept fluctuating between 20% and somewhere in the 90s when i open the HTML coverage file.

Version Control: About 60 commits.
